TostaTetris combines programming, creativity, and the reuse of everyday objects to create a collaborative and playful gaming experience. Using **Python with Pygame** and a **Makey Makey**, this project introduces a cooperative version of the classic Tetris game.  

The **Makey Makey**, a device that transforms almost any object into an interactive controller, was integrated into an **old toaster**. The metal elements of the toaster were repurposed as touch-sensitive controls. By touching these metallic parts, two players can share the same screen and collaborate to play Tetris together.  

This project explores themes of **collaboration**, **recycling**, and **hands-on interaction**. By combining physical objects with digital gameplay, Tostatetris invites participants to engage in a fun and accessible experience that reimagines how we play games and interact with everyday objects.
